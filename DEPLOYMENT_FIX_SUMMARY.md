# GitHub Pages 404 Fix - Summary

## Problem Diagnosed

Your website at https://danieloseguin67.github.io/roxanebelangerv2/ was showing a 404 error because the GitHub Actions workflow was uploading the wrong directory.

### Root Cause
- **Angular build output location**: `dist/roxane-belanger-app/browser/` (contains index.html, JS, CSS, assets)
- **Workflow was uploading**: `dist/roxane-belanger-app/` (parent directory without the actual site files)
- **Result**: GitHub Pages received an empty directory structure, causing the 404 error

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed the 404 Error

**File Changed**: `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml`

**Change Made**: Updated line 67 from:
```yaml
path: ./dist/${{ steps.extract-names.outputs.project-name }}
```

To:
```yaml
path: ./dist/${{ steps.extract-names.outputs.project-name }}/browser
```

This ensures the workflow uploads the correct directory containing your website files.

### 2. ✅ Added Email Notifications

**Added**: Email notification functionality that sends you an email at `danieloseguin67@gmail.com` when deployment succeeds.

**Email Content Includes**:
- Repository name
- Branch name
- Commit SHA
- Link to workflow run
- Direct link to your live website

**Configuration Required**: You need to add two secrets to your GitHub repository (see below).

### 3. ✅ Verified Images

**Status**: All images are correctly included in the deployment.

**Location**: Images from `public/assets/images/` are automatically copied to `dist/roxane-belanger-app/browser/assets/images/` during the build process.

## Required Actions

### Configure Email Notifications (Optional)

To receive email notifications, you need to configure two GitHub repository secrets:

1. **Go to your repository settings**:
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/danieloseguin67/roxanebelangerv2/settings/secrets/actions
   
2. **Create Gmail App Password**:
   - Visit: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Generate a new app password for "GitHub Actions"
   - Copy the 16-character password

3. **Add these two secrets**:
   - Secret Name: `MAIL_USERNAME`, Value: `danieloseguin67@gmail.com`
   - Secret Name: `MAIL_PASSWORD`, Value: Your 16-character Gmail app password

See `EMAIL_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.
